# FedHDPrivacy

This repository contains the code for **Federated Hyperdimensional Computing with Privacy-preserving (FedHDPrivacy)**, an explainable AI-based federated learning framework designed specifically for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. FedHDPrivacy ensures strong privacy protection through Differential Privacy (DP) and significantly outperforms traditional federated learning methods, particularly in dynamic IoT settings.

## Key Features

- **Federated Learning**: Trains AI models across distributed IoT devices without compromising data privacy.
- **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)**: Leverages high-dimensional vector representations to enable robust and computationally efficient AI models.
- **Differential Privacy (DP)**: Ensures data privacy by introducing mathematically controlled noise, offering strong protection against inference attacks.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Provides transparency and interpretability of the model outcomes and privacy trade-offs.
